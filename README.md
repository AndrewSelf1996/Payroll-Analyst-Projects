# Payroll-Analyst-Projects
Here are some of the projects I am working on in my current role as a Payroll Analyst for the Private Fleet of Dollar General


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Weekly Payroll Time Audit Review | I receive a raw data file weekly containing all of the manual edits that were made for the previous week's payroll. I clean the data and utilize Vlookups and Pivot Tables to provide summaries and insights into all of the edits made by manager and site.
| 2 | Weekly NDR Reconciliation Report | For this report, I reconcile the previous week's payroll data to ensure that payments made align with submissions made at both the site and driver level.
